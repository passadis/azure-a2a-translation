## üåê GitHub Codespaces - Zero Setup Deployment

This template is fully configured for **GitHub Codespaces**, providing a complete cloud development environment with zero local setup required. The dev container includes:

- **Azure Developer CLI (azd)** - Pre-installed and ready to use
- **Azure CLI** - For Azure authentication and resource management
- **Terraform** - For infrastructure as code deployment
- **Docker** - For container building and deployment
- **Python 3.11** - With all project dependencies
- **VS Code Extensions** - Essential tools for Azure development

### Using Codespaces:

1. **Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" badge** above or visit the repository
2. **Create a new Codespace** - The environment will automatically configure itself
3. **Deploy to Azure** with just two commands:
   ```bash
   azd auth login
   azd up
   ```

No need to install anything locally - everything runs in the cloud! Perfect for developers who want to try the template quickly or work from any device.

## üöÄ Quick Deploy with Azure Developer CLI

Deploy this entire solution to Azure with just two commands:

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```
## Remember you should have logged in with Azure CLI or switched to your target subscription:
```bash
az login
az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
```

That's it! The `azd up` command will:
- Initialize the project environment
- Provision all Azure infrastructure using Terraform
- Build and deploy the containerized applications
- Configure managed identity and RBAC permissions
- Set up monitoring and logging

**Total deployment time: ~5-10 minutes**

### Start Docker

Make sure Docker Desktop is running before deployment:

```bash
# On Windows, start Docker Desktop application
# On Linux/macOS, ensure Docker daemon is running
docker --version
```

### Deploy the Application

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```

The `azd up` command handles everything automatically - infrastructure provisioning and application deployment in one go!

### Verify Deployment

Check the deployment status:
```bash
azd show
```

Get the application URLs:
```bash
azd env get-values
```

Access your deployed application:
- **Web GUI**: Open `WEB_GUI_URL` in your browser for the translation interface
- **Translation API**: Use `TRANSLATION_AGENT_URL` for direct API access
- **Agent Discovery**: Get agent capabilities at `TRANSLATION_AGENT_URL/agent-card`

## Alternative Deployment Methods

### Option 1: Step-by-Step Deployment

If you prefer to see each step after initializing with `azd init --template`:

```bash
# 1. Set Environment Variables (Optional)
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION northeurope  # Default: westeurope

# 2. Deploy Infrastructure
azd provision

# 3. Build and Deploy Applications
azd deploy

# 4. Verify Deployment
azd show
```

### Option 2: Clone Repository (Traditional Method)

If you prefer to clone the repository directly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/passadis/azure-a2a-translation.git
cd azure-a2a-translation

# Ensure Docker is running
docker --version

# Deploy everything
azd auth login
azd up
```

## Usage

### Using the Web Interface

1. Open the Web GUI URL in your browser
2. Upload a text file (.txt)
3. Select target language
4. Click "Translate"
5. View results in real-time as they complete

### Using the API Directly

### Using the API Directly

Submit a Translation Request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-translation-agent-url/execute_task" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "envelope": {
      "task_id": "test-123",
      "target_language": "es"
    },
    "parts": {
      "document_content": "Hello, world!"
    }
  }'
```

Check Task Status:
```bash
curl "https://your-translation-agent-url/task_status/test-123"
```

### Check Service Health

```bash
curl "https://your-translation-agent-url/health"
curl "https://your-web-gui-url/health"
```

### Agent Discovery

```bash
# Get agent capabilities and endpoints (dynamically generated by the agent)
curl "https://your-translation-agent-url/agent-card"
```

**Note**: Agent discovery is now fully dynamic. The translation agent publishes its own capabilities and current endpoints through the `/agent-card` endpoint, eliminating the need for static configuration files.

## Configuration

The services are configured through environment variables:

- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: Storage account name (set by Terraform)
- `AZURE_TRANSLATOR_ENDPOINT`: Translator service endpoint (set by Terraform)
- `AZURE_TRANSLATOR_REGION`: Azure region (set by Terraform)
- `AZURE_TRANSLATOR_RESOURCE_ID`: Translator resource ID for Entra ID authentication (set by Terraform)
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Managed identity client ID (set by Terraform)
- `TRANSLATION_JOBS_QUEUE`: Jobs queue name (default: "translation-jobs")
- `TRANSLATION_RESULTS_QUEUE`: Results queue name (default: "translation-results")

## User Experience

### True Non-Blocking A2A Experience

This template delivers a genuinely asynchronous Agent-to-Agent experience:

1. **Immediate Response**: Submit translation requests and get instant confirmation
2. **Stay Productive**: Continue submitting more translations while others process
3. **Real-Time Updates**: See results appear automatically as they complete
4. **No Waiting**: Never blocked waiting for translations to finish
5. **History Management**: View up to 5 recent translations with clean history option

## Security Features

- **No API Keys**: Uses Azure Managed Identity for all authentication
- **RBAC**: Least privilege access to Azure services
- **Secure Storage**: Storage account configured without public access
- **TLS**: All communication encrypted in transit
- **Container Security**: Uses slim Python base images

## Monitoring

- Application logs available in Azure Log Analytics
- Container App metrics in Azure Monitor
- Storage queue metrics available
- Translator service usage metrics available

## Scaling

- Translation Agent: Scales 1-3 instances based on HTTP load
- Translation Worker: Runs single instance (can be increased if needed)
- Queue-based architecture allows for independent scaling

## Cost Optimization

- Uses Basic SKU for Container Registry
- Standard LRS for Storage Account
- S1 tier for Translator service (pay-per-use)
- Container Apps scale to zero when not in use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Error (401 Unauthorized)
- **Issue**: Translation worker gets "401 Client Error: Unauthorized" when calling Azure Translator
- **Cause**: Missing Entra ID authentication headers for global endpoint
- **Solution**: The template includes proper authentication headers (`Ocp-Apim-ResourceId` and `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region`). If you modify the code, ensure these headers are included when using the global translator endpoint.

#### Queue Messages Not Processing
- **Issue**: Translation worker shows "No messages found" even though agent is queuing messages
- **Cause**: Worker crashed or stuck messages due to visibility timeout
- **Solution**: Restart the translation worker:
  ```bash
  az containerapp revision restart --name translation-worker --resource-group <your-resource-group>
  ```

#### Worker Stops Processing After First Job
- **Issue**: First translation succeeds, but subsequent jobs stay "pending"
- **Cause**: Message visibility timeout or worker exception
- **Solution**: Check worker logs and restart if needed:
  ```bash
  az containerapp logs show --name translation-worker --resource-group <your-resource-group> --follow
  ```

#### Docker Build Fails
- **Issue**: Docker build fails with "no such file or directory"
- **Solution**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and you're in the correct directory:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  cd azure-a2a-translation
  ```

#### Missing .env File Error
- **Issue**: Build fails because .env file is missing
- **Solution**: The Dockerfiles now handle missing .env files automatically. If you still see issues, create an empty .env file:
  ```bash
  touch .env
  ```

#### Static Directory Missing (Web GUI)
- **Issue**: Web GUI build fails due to missing static directory
- **Solution**: The static directory and basic files are now included in the repository. If missing, they will be created automatically during build.


### Verify Queue Messages
Use Azure Storage Explorer or Azure Portal to check queue status

### Test Managed Identity
Check that the Container Apps have the correct identity assignments in the Azure Portal

### Docker Build Locally (for testing)
```bash
# Test translation agent build
docker build -f translation-agent.Dockerfile -t test-agent .

# Test translation worker build  
docker build -f translation-worker.Dockerfile -t test-worker .

# Test web GUI build
cd web-gui
docker build -f web-gui.Dockerfile -t test-web-gui .
```

## Cleanup

To remove all resources:
```bash
azd down
```
